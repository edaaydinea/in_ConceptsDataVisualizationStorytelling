    "* Storytelling is Ancient and Important: Storytelling isn't just a modern trend; it's been crucial for humans since ancient times. Every culture has always told stories because they help us survive and understand the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evolutionary Advantage: Just like we crave certain foods for survival, we crave stories. Stories help us deal with anxiety and learn how to handle challenges. For example, ancient humans would tell stories about hunting to share important information about where to find food and how to stay safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stories and Data: Even when sharing data, like numbers and facts, wrapping it in a story makes it more engaging and easier to understand. For instance, instead of just listing hunting statistics, ancient humans would tell a story about the hunt, making the information memorable and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scientific Support: Research shows that scientists who use storytelling techniques in their reports are cited more often. This means storytelling helps in making scientific information more impactful and widely understood.\n",

    "* Communication is Key: No matter your job, being a good communicator is crucial. Even if you work with data, you need to explain your findings clearly to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stories are Memorable: Stories are much more memorable than plain facts. For example, a story about a poor child giving an apple to a teacher is more impactful than just stating poverty statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Engage the Brain: Stories activate more parts of our brain than plain data, making them more memorable and emotionally engaging.\n",

    "* When Not to Use Stories: Sometimes, you don't need a story. For example, dashboards used by experts for data exploration might not need a narrative. They are tools, not communication devices.\n",

    "* Balanced Approach: Often, the best approach is a mix. Use stories to provide context and direction but allow some interaction with the data for deeper exploration.\n",

    "* Design Tips: Use things like headlines and highlights to guide people through your data. These elements help introduce and explain key points.\n",
    "* Reading Order: People might not read your chart or infographic in order, but they'll still piece together the story from different parts.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Sketching helps you quickly test and refine your ideas before creating final visualizations.\n",

    "**Tools:** Use simple tools like pen and paper, whiteboards, or basic drawing programs. Avoid complex software at this stage.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example:** Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth\" contrasts the current state of climate change with potential future outcomes if behaviors are changed.\n",

    "**Fun Example:** A project comparing Google searches for \"Why does my dog...\" versus \"Why does my cat...\" illustrates how people are curious about different behaviors in pets.\n",
